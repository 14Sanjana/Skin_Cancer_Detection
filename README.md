# Skin_Cancer_Detection  
# 🧠 Skin Cancer Detection App using MobileNet

A deep learning web application that classifies skin lesions from dermoscopic images using a fine-tuned **MobileNet** model. The app provides predictions with confidence scores, risk levels, and suggested precautions.

## 📌 Features

- 🏥 Predicts 7 classes of skin cancer (e.g., MEL, NV, BKL, etc.)
- 📈 Displays confidence score and medical risk level
- 🧴 Recommends basic precautionary measures
- 🖼️ Interactive image upload interface (built with **Streamlit**)


## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit (Web UI)
- OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)


## 📸 Sample Output

- Predicted Class: BKL  
- Confidence:44.41%  
- Risk Level: Low  
- Precautions: Harmless but monitor for changes. Keep skin moisturized.
